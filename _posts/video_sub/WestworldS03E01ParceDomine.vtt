我很想你
I missed you.

我也想你
I missed you.

这次又是要给你什么颁发什么奖项
What are you being feted for this time?

313
00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:25.250
其实  我都不记得了
Oh, you know. I can't even remember.

314
00:27:25.250 --> 00:27:27.070
奖励你通过算法拯救了世界
For saving the world through algorithms.

315
00:27:27.470 --> 00:27:30.170
或者说  因为你是那个拯救世界之人的儿子
Or for being the son of the guy who saved the world.

失陪一下
Excuse me a sec.

317
00:27:33.130 --> 00:27:36.650
你就是他上个月在缅甸认识的神秘女孩
You're the mysterious girl he met in Burma last month.

318
00:27:38.740 --> 00:27:40.180
很漂亮
So pretty...

319
00:27:40.980 --> 00:27:44.020
但你不像他一般交往的那种女人
but you're not like the women that he usually dates.

320
00:27:44.020 --> 00:27:45.240
你来自哪里
Where are you from?

321
00:27:45.990 --> 00:27:47.840
西部的一个小镇
Uh, a small town out west.

322
00:27:48.260 --> 00:27:49.850
不为人知的小地方
Sort of off the beaten path.

323
00:27:50.660 --> 00:27:53.150
这杯酒的价钱
The contents of this glass cost three times

324
00:27:53.150 --> 00:27:55.090
是我父亲年薪的三倍
what my father made in a year.

325
00:27:55.210 --> 00:27:57.040
所以这根本不重要
That's why it doesn't fucking matter.

326
00:27:57.040 --> 00:27:58.520
也正因此才让我们确定
That's how you know for sure.

327
00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:00.930
-确定什么  -别让他打开话匣子
- Know what? - Please don't get him started.

328
00:28:00.930 --> 00:28:03.530
他一嗨起来  就他妈喜欢说这些事
When he gets high, this is all he fucking talks about.

329
00:28:03.530 --> 00:28:05.280
这一切都不是真的
That none of this is real.

330
00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:10.940
我说真的  我们活在模拟中
I'm serious. We are living in a simulation.

331
00:28:11.370 --> 00:28:12.600
但可笑的是我们
The joke's on us, though.

332
00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:15.440
我们就跟提洛的性爱人偶一模一样
It's like with those fuck puppets at Delos.

333
00:28:15.740 --> 00:28:18.420
至少他们有尊严反抗  杀了所有人
Least they had the dignity to revolt and kill everyone.

334
00:28:18.420 --> 00:28:20.130
他们杀了董事会成员
They killed the board of directors,

335
00:28:20.130 --> 00:28:22.130
这我倒是挺支持的
which I can get behind, frankly.

336
00:28:22.130 --> 00:28:25.100
你仔细想想  想一下
Just think about this. For one second.

337
00:28:25.290 --> 00:28:27.540
如果他们在模拟中创建模拟
How fucking ironic would it be

338
00:28:27.590 --> 00:28:30.760
那他妈得有多讽刺啊
if they had put a simulation within a simulation?

339
00:28:31.050 --> 00:28:32.930
那简直是大写的"卧槽"
That's a massive "Fuck you."

340
00:28:33.620 --> 00:28:34.830
你觉得呢  劳拉
What do you think, Lara?

341
00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:40.030
我觉得人们会相信有助于自己的东西
I think that people believe the things that help them.

342
00:28:42.270 --> 00:28:44.110
当然  也可能是大脑在作祟
Course, it could just be this.

343
00:28:47.820 --> 00:28:49.810

Nucleus accumbens.

344
00:28:49.810 --> 00:28:53.220
你大脑的一小部分  长约4厘米
It's a small part of your brain, about an inch and a half long.

345
00:28:56.090 --> 00:28:58.650
就是这东西使你信奉上帝
It's the part of you that evolved to believe in God.

346
00:28:59.110 --> 00:29:00.100
我是个无神论者
I'm an atheist.

347
00:29:00.590 --> 00:29:02.800
你也许不信神  但...
You may not believe in a higher power, but...

348
00:29:03.370 --> 00:29:04.820
你的意识生来就是会信的
your mind was built to.

349
00:29:04.950 --> 00:29:06.690
这也不是他第一次被一根约4厘米的东西
Well, it wouldn't be the first time he's been led around

350
00:29:06.690 --> 00:29:08.840
牵着鼻子走了
by something an inch and a half long.

351
00:29:13.300 --> 00:29:14.200
失陪
Excuse me.

352
00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:24.380
我们遇到问题了
We have a problem.

353
00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:26.470
合伙人们想见面
Our partners want to meet.

354
00:29:26.470 --> 00:29:27.450
我没时间
I don't have time.

355
00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:29.520
我今晚要回洛杉矶
I'm heading back to LA tonight.

356
00:29:30.330 --> 00:29:31.720
他们会来找我们
They'll come to us.

357
00:29:32.210 --> 00:29:33.440
他们说很紧急
They say it's urgent.

358
00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:35.300
我真没时间
I really don't have time.

359
00:29:35.610 --> 00:29:38.740
我强烈建议你跟他们见一面
I strongly suggest that you take this meeting.

360
00:29:47.460 --> 00:29:49.370

Come with me. Tomorrow.

361
00:29:49.750 --> 00:29:51.250

I can't. I have meetings here.

363
00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:55.840
休息一天
Take a day off.

364
00:29:57.630 --> 00:29:59.730
我们可以在我恩塞纳达的船上见面
We can meet my boat in Ensenada,

365
00:29:59.730 --> 00:30:01.520
然后航海去洛杉矶
then sail up to LA.

366
00:30:04.390 --> 00:30:07.050
行吧  就一两天
Maybe. For a day or two.

367
00:30:08.890 --> 00:30:11.080
我打算在那里见我的一些朋友
I have some friends I've been meaning to see there.

368
00:30:28.620 --> 00:30:30.700
跟我谈谈  你有什么想法
Talk to me. Where's your head at?

369
00:30:31.100 --> 00:30:32.530
你又有那些黑暗想法了吗
You having those dark thought again?

370
00:30:32.980 --> 00:30:35.460
没有  我想保持积极的心态
No. Trying to stay positive.

371
00:30:35.620 --> 00:30:38.470
提高我的分数  参加工作面试
Bringing my scores up, interviewing for jobs.

372

You're next.

只是尽力不失业而已
Just trying to stay employed.

375
00:30:50.710 --> 00:30:52.430
你最近有接他的电话吗
Have you been taking his phone calls?

376
00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:54.340
偶尔
Sometimes.

377
00:30:55.290 --> 00:30:57.890
说实话  我觉得和你谈也一样
Honestly, I feel just as comfortable talking to you.

378
00:30:58.200 --> 00:30:59.800
我还有别的病人  卡尔
I have other patients, Cal.

379
00:31:00.540 --> 00:31:01.520
能给你的时间有限
Limited time.

380
00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:04.520
弗朗西斯毕竟陪你走过了
Francis is one of the people who knew you best

381
00:31:04.520 --> 00:31:06.670
人生最艰难的一个时期  他最了解你
at a challenging time in your life.

382
00:31:07.420 --> 00:31:12.100
你们一起服役的时候  仔细观察了彼此
When you're serving together, you observe each other up close.

383
00:31:12.840 --> 00:31:16.310
你们也仔细观察了我们
Well, you guys observed us pretty closely, too.

384
00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:19.540
不就是这么回事吗
That's how it works, right?

385
00:31:20.890 --> 00:31:23.050
我不想再跟你解释我们这个项目的好处
I'm not gonna lecture you about the benefits of our program.

386
00:31:23.050 --> 00:31:25.710
不如由你来告诉我  你是怎样的想法
Why don't you tell me? What do you think?

387
00:31:30.430 --> 00:31:33.170
我觉得获得好处是有条件的
I think my benefits are conditional

388
00:31:33.170 --> 00:31:36.340
只有参与才有
on the fact that I participate.

389
00:31:37.650 --> 00:31:39.670
只参与是不够的
Well, participation isn't sufficient.

390
00:31:39.750 --> 00:31:41.270
重要的是向前看
It's important that you move on.

391
00:31:41.850 --> 00:31:47.110
不如你来说说自己是怎么到这一步的吧  卡尔
So... why don't tell me how did you get here, Cal?

392
00:31:59.270 --> 00:32:01.430
你是个聪明人  卡莱布
You're a smart guy, Caleb.

393
00:32:01.830 --> 00:32:03.870
也许这个项目是狗屁
Maybe the program is bullshit.

394
00:32:09.510 --> 00:32:11.720
但有一件事我是可以肯定的
But there's one thing I know for sure.

395
00:32:12.950 --> 00:32:17.630
你要是不试试  就永远不知道它管不管用
If you don't try, it definitely won't work.

嗨过头了
Must come down.

410
00:33:46.910 --> 00:33:48.910
他想尝试一种新型刺激性药物
He wanted to try some beta limbics,

411
00:33:48.910 --> 00:33:50.610
然后就精神失常了
then he just fucking lost it.

傻逼新手  他的终端呢
Fucking noob. Where's his terminal?

413
00:33:53.740 --> 00:33:54.520
说他看见了光
Said he'd seen the light

414
00:33:54.520 --> 00:33:56.140
我们不能把光夺走
and we couldn't take it from him.

415
00:33:56.480 --> 00:33:58.900
所以才给他用了50毫升的镇静剂
Hence the 50 CCs of tranquilo.

00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:04.770
我不接私人活
I don't do personals.

419
00:34:05.550 --> 00:34:06.910
你们还是叫救护车吧
Let's just call an ambulance.

420
00:34:06.910 --> 00:34:08.350
他在尝试违禁药物
He's demoing illegals.

421
00:34:08.350 --> 00:34:10.470
她说他还有前科  起码进去20年
She said he's got a prior, that's 20 years.

422
00:34:10.470 --> 00:34:13.000
那他就跟我们一样入狱
So he goes to jail just like the rest of us.

423
00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:15.980
他跟我们不一样  他是高资产净值人士
Dude's not like the rest of us. High net worth.

424

规矩就是这样
That's how this shit works.

425
00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:28.850
我想起你之前跟我说过的一句话
I think about what you told me once,

426
00:34:29.670 --> 00:34:31.730
在我们被救出来的时候
when we were being medevac'd out.

427
00:34:32.350 --> 00:34:34.590
是吗  我说什么了
Oh, yeah? What did I say?

428
00:34:34.850 --> 00:34:37.710
你说他们把整个世界做成一个游戏
You said they'd built the world to be a game.

429
00:34:39.370 --> 00:34:40.620
然后他们暗箱操纵
And then they rigged it...

430
00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:44.490
确保赢的总是他们
to make sure they always won.

431

When was the last time you were back?

很久了
Quite some time.

434
00:35:14.580 --> 00:35:17.330
从上面看感觉还挺合理的
Almost looks like it makes sense from up here.

能看到的只有秩序  计划
All you see is the order of it. The plan.

436
00:35:22.380 --> 00:35:23.740
你是说你的计划
Your plan, you mean.

437
00:35:25.630 --> 00:35:27.600
这一切不都由「动悉」公司在控制吗
Doesn't Incite control all of it?

438
00:35:28.150 --> 00:35:29.360
哪怕是交通
Even the traffic?

439
00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:31.270
我们只是家科技公司而已
We're just a technology company.

00:35:35.060 --> 00:35:37.160
我们只是恰好在正确的时间和地点出现了
We were just in the right place at the right time.

441
00:35:37.640 --> 00:35:41.190
都要归功于我爸爸  我们有着最好的人工智能

444
00:36:21.560 --> 00:36:23.230
却花了15年才造出来
Took him 15 years to build it.

445
00:36:24.260 --> 00:36:26.390
他们最后一次优化后
After they optimized it for the last time,

446
00:36:26.390 --> 00:36:29.120
就无法记录每秒产生多少想法了
they lost track of how many thoughts it has per second.

447
00:36:29.510 --> 00:36:30.350
想法
Thoughts?

448
00:36:30.630 --> 00:36:34.820
也不完全是想法  算是策略
Not thoughts, exactly. Strategies.

449
00:36:36.580 --> 00:36:38.940
我爸爸觉得这个世界最大的问题
My dad thought the biggest problem in the world

450
00:36:38.940 --> 00:36:40.690
就是未实现的潜力
was unrealized potential.

451
00:36:40.690 --> 00:36:45.080
他觉得如果能给每个人都定制一套方案
He thought that if you could chart a course for every single person,

452
00:36:45.290 --> 00:36:47.410
这个世界就会变得更好
then you could make the world a better place.

453
00:36:47.710 --> 00:36:49.220
给每个人指明道路
A path for everyone.

454
00:36:51.980 --> 00:36:53.340
我小时候还担心
And when I was a kid, I used to worry

455
00:36:53.340 --> 00:36:57.190
比起我  我爸爸更在乎这东西
that my father cared more about this thing than me.

456
00:36:57.510 --> 00:37:00.950
我长大后才意识到  我比它差得远了
When I grew up, I realized... it wasn't even close.

457
00:37:09.770 --> 00:37:10.780
失陪一下
Excuse me for a second.

458
00:37:10.780 --> 00:37:11.540
好
Yeah.

459
00:37:15.650 --> 00:37:16.350
怎么了
What?

460
00:37:16.940 --> 00:37:18.250
她要见你
She wants to see you.

461
00:37:18.450 --> 00:37:20.830
现在吗  不能等等吗
Now? Can't wait?

462
00:37:22.370 --> 00:37:23.280
恐怕不行
Afraid not.

463
00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:25.230
好吧
Okay.

464
00:37:28.940 --> 00:37:31.510
非常抱歉  我的会议提前了
I'm so sorry. My meeting got pulled up.

465
00:37:31.510 --> 00:37:33.030
我的人可以送你去任何地方
My guys can drop you anywhere you want.

466
00:37:33.030 --> 00:37:34.510
我可以照顾好自己
I can take care of myself.

467
00:37:34.510 --> 00:37:36.250
-真的吗  那今晚见  -好
- Yeah? Can I meet you tonight? - Yeah.

468
00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:38.270
好的
Okay.

469
00:37:57.800 --> 00:38:00.450
给我找个速度快的车  马上
Find me something fast. Now.

470
00:38:00.710 --> 00:38:01.610
定位中
Locating.

471
00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:39.800
给我在大楼里租一间公寓
Rent me an apartment in the building.

472
00:38:40.380 --> 00:38:42.720
正在以劳拉·埃斯彭的名义协商租约
Negotiating lease for Lara Espen.

473
00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:47.760
租约已敲定
Lease secured.

474
00:39:04.040 --> 00:39:05.050
放大
Zoom in.

475
00:39:06.180 --> 00:39:07.160
声音切进来
With sound.

476
00:39:07.740 --> 00:39:09.130
我不喜欢被人使唤
I don't like being summoned.

477
00:39:09.130 --> 00:39:11.820
我们不喜欢出现意外
We don't like being surprised.

478
00:39:11.900 --> 00:39:14.260
数据中出现了一些波动
There's been some turbulence in the data.

479
00:39:14.440 --> 00:39:16.760
数据嘛  波动是必然存在的
It's data. It's made of turbulence.

480
00:39:16.810 --> 00:39:19.080
也出现了一些偏差
There have been discrepancies.

481
00:39:19.230 --> 00:39:22.530
我们认为有人获取了进入罗波安的权限
We think someone may have acquired access to Rehoboam.

482
00:39:22.660 --> 00:39:25.670
水平非常高  前所未见
A level of sophistication we haven't seen before.

483
00:39:25.680 --> 00:39:28.410
-滚  -就像有人在测试系统
- Fuck off. - Like someone is testing the system.

484
00:39:28.510 --> 00:39:32.430
哪怕有人在尝试  罗波安也会发出警报
Rehoboam itself would alert us if anybody even tried.

485
00:39:32.830 --> 00:39:35.610
如果是外面的人在尝试  那一定有警报
If someone from the outside tried, yes.

486
00:39:35.830 --> 00:39:38.260
但是如果他们找到了已有权限的人
But if they abused the trust of someone

487
00:39:38.260 --> 00:39:39.690
并且滥用那个人的信任
who already had access--

488
00:39:39.690 --> 00:39:42.090
你是在暗示我的团队里有内鬼吗
If you're asking if there's a leak on my end,

489
00:39:42.100 --> 00:39:43.360
我的回答是  滚你妈的
the answer is fuck you.

490
00:39:43.360 --> 00:39:45.660
去查你们的人吧  我们这边没问题
Look at your own people. We're fine.

491
00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:47.500
我们没有你这种自信
We don't share your confidence.

492
00:39:49.230 --> 00:39:50.860
"我们"这说法真可笑
I love the royal "We."

493
00:39:50.860 --> 00:39:52.480
你根本不用动脑子
You don't think.

494
00:39:52.480 --> 00:39:53.980
他说什么你就做什么
You do what he tells you.

495
00:39:54.090 --> 00:39:57.310
他  没有你这种自信
He... doesn't share your confidence.

496
00:39:57.360 --> 00:40:01.470
他应该担心的是他真正要处理的问题
He should be concerning himself with actual fucking problems

497
00:40:01.930 --> 00:40:03.930
比如提洛公司那场灾难
like the shitshow at Delos.

498
00:40:04.060 --> 00:40:06.010
为什么我们应该担心那件事
Why would that concern us at all?

499
00:40:07.530 --> 00:40:09.150
就当我是瞎猜的吧
Call it a wild guess.

500
00:40:12.310 --> 00:40:16.260
你不会用系统在监视我们吧
You wouldn't be using the system to look at us, would you?

501
00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:19.710
要杀你的确挺棘手的
It would be an inconvenience to kill you,

502
00:40:19.710 --> 00:40:21.860
但我们有你爸爸的系统
but we'd have your daddy's system

503
00:40:21.870 --> 00:40:26.240
来帮我们策划谋杀行动  不是吗
to help us strategize how to deal with it. Wouldn't we?

504
00:41:09.030 --> 00:41:09.730
你好啊
Howdy.

505
00:41:13.450 --> 00:41:15.270
我不想...惹麻烦
I don't... want any trouble.

506
00:41:15.270 --> 00:41:16.230
你当然不想
Of course not.

507
00:41:16.840 --> 00:41:19.610
那会引起太多的关注  不是吗  伯纳德
It'd draw too much attention. Wouldn't it, Bernard?

508
00:41:22.930 --> 00:41:26.160
我也不是天才  但我能识别出逃犯
I'm no genius, but I know a man on the run.

509
00:41:27.250 --> 00:41:28.540
你就是个逃犯  不是吗
That's what you are, isn't it?

510
00:41:29.860 --> 00:41:31.200
{\an8}通缉犯

511
00:41:31.440 --> 00:41:33.180
就觉得你不像是屠夫
Wouldn't have had you pegged as a butcher.

512
00:41:40.020 --> 00:41:42.290
事实并非像他们说的那样
It's... not what they say.

513
00:41:43.640 --> 00:41:44.890
这很复杂
It's complicated.

514
00:41:45.950 --> 00:41:46.960
我不这么觉得
I don't think so.

515
00:41:53.650 --> 00:41:54.190
李
Lee.

516
00:41:54.330 --> 00:41:57.450
抓住在逃杀人犯有多少现金奖励
What's the cash reward on a fat cat-murdering fugitive?

517
00:41:57.450 --> 00:41:58.430
大概数额
Ballpark.

518
00:41:59.260 --> 00:42:00.230
{\pos(190,235)}特别多

519
00:42:01.890 --> 00:42:03.750
那正是我的友谊的价格
That's exactly the price of my friendship.

520
00:42:03.750 --> 00:42:06.250
我没有...任何东西可以给你
I don't have... anything to give you.

521
00:42:06.980 --> 00:42:09.730
等等  你们马上有灭顶之灾了
Wait! Wait! Wait! Something very bad is coming for you all.

522
00:42:10.010 --> 00:42:11.180
我不知道如何阻止
Something I don't know how to stop.

523
00:42:11.180 --> 00:42:12.490
她已经策划好几个月了
She's had months to plan.

524
00:42:12.500 --> 00:42:14.170
我独自一人  我无法信任我自己
I'm alone, and I can't trust myself!

525
00:42:15.240 --> 00:42:17.200
没有其他人的帮助  我无法阻止她
Without someone to help me, I can't stop her,

526
00:42:17.200 --> 00:42:18.380
我救不了你们
I can't save any of you.

527
00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:21.190
我们不是需要被拯救的人
We're not the ones who need to be saved.

528
00:42:27.480 --> 00:42:30.990
记起你自己  请不要伤害他们...
Remember yourself. Please don't hurt them...

529
00:42:31.400 --> 00:42:32.700
别伤得太重
too badly.

530
00:42:32.970 --> 00:42:34.280
你他妈在跟我说话吗
The fuck you saying to me?

531
00:43:36.520 --> 00:43:38.140
我觉得你应该直面现实了
I think you need to face the truth.

532
00:43:38.610 --> 00:43:40.520
我们在那里的遭遇确实很可怕
What happened to us over there was fucked up.

533
00:43:41.190 --> 00:43:43.130
但你需要释怀了  我们赢了
But you need to let go; we won.

534
00:43:43.570 --> 00:43:44.990
我不想谈论那件事
I don't wanna talk about that.

535
00:43:45.630 --> 00:43:49.020
老实说  我都不确定我为何还要跟你谈
Honestly, I'm not even sure why we're talking,

536
00:43:49.350 --> 00:43:51.250
我该如何脱离这一切
what I'm supposed to get out of this.

537
00:43:51.450 --> 00:43:53.330
每个人都需要一个可以谈心的人
Everybody needs someone to talk to.

538
00:43:54.290 --> 00:43:56.120
如果不想最后回到退伍军人事务部
Don't wanna wind up back in the VA.

539
00:43:56.530 --> 00:43:58.090
盯紧你的赏金
Keep your eyes on the prize.

540
00:44:00.970 --> 00:44:01.640
你好
Hello.

541
00:44:01.650 --> 00:44:03.670
你好  我是来自DCA的肖恩
HI, this is Sean from DCA.

542
00:44:03.670 --> 00:44:06.050
好的好的  这通电话是关于我的岗位吗
Yeah, yeah. Is this about the position?

543
00:44:06.200 --> 00:44:07.520
听着  卡莱布
Listen, Caleb.

544
00:44:07.550 --> 00:44:09.430
你的申请简历非常优秀
Your application was very strong.

545
00:44:09.570 --> 00:44:10.640
不幸的是
Unfortunately,

546
00:44:10.670 --> 00:44:12.740
我们的战略部门暂时没有空缺
our strategy group hasn't found an opening.

547
00:44:17.820 --> 00:44:18.600
卡莱布
Caleb?

548
00:44:18.790 --> 00:44:19.800
你在听吗
Are you still with me?

549
00:44:23.350 --> 00:44:25.480
好的  谢谢你
Okay. Thank you.

550
00:44:25.890 --> 00:44:27.840
在哪些方面我可以努努力
Look, is there anything I should be working on

551
00:44:27.840 --> 00:44:29.940
让我自己成为一个更好的申请人呢
to make myself a better candidate?

552
00:44:30.220 --> 00:44:32.440
正如我说的  你的申请简历非常优秀
Like I said, your application was strong.

553
00:44:32.480 --> 00:44:33.510
只是目前我们没有
We just don't have anything

554
00:44:33.510 --> 00:44:35.550
特别适合你的岗位
that would be a great fit for you right now.

555
00:44:35.550 --> 00:44:39.030
好的  但是...如果没有适合我的岗位
Sure, but, um... You know, if I'm not a good fit,

556
00:44:39.030 --> 00:44:42.670
有没有其他岗位我可以尝试一下呢
is there a different shape I could squeeze myself into?

557
00:44:50.040 --> 00:44:54.170
无意冒犯  但  你是人类吗
No offense, but... are you human?

558
00:44:54.810 --> 00:44:55.740
我是肖恩
I'm Sean.

559
00:44:55.740 --> 00:44:58.560
我可以帮助你利用DCA的所有资源
I can help you with all kinds of resources for DCA.

560
00:44:58.560 --> 00:45:00.610
请问还有什么需要帮助的吗  卡莱布
Anything else I can do for you today, Caleb?

561
00:45:00.920 --> 00:45:03.310
没有了  谢谢
No, it's all right. Thanks.

562
00:45:06.070 --> 00:45:09.290
{\an8}{\pos(254.065,32.727)}锐客

563
00:45:34.070 --> 00:45:35.900
我想让他们别再来烦我了
and I want them off my back, now.

564
00:45:40.030 --> 00:45:42.810
你知道他有那个本事  处理好就行了
You know he's capable of it. Just handle it!

565
00:45:50.030 --> 00:45:51.090
出什么事了吗
Is something wrong?

566
00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:52.870
抱歉
I'm sorry.

567
00:45:55.440 --> 00:45:57.190
我本来希望今夜只属于我们
I wanted this night to be ours.

568
00:45:59.840 --> 00:46:02.160
听着  听我说
Listen. Listen to me.

569
00:46:02.760 --> 00:46:05.620
我了解你  无论你告诉我什么事
I know you. There's nothing you can tell me

570
00:46:05.620 --> 00:46:07.530
都不会改变我对你的感觉
that will make me feel differently about you.

571
00:46:08.960 --> 00:46:10.490
你显然是陷入什么麻烦了
You're in some sort of trouble.

572
00:46:11.610 --> 00:46:13.330
请让我帮你吧
Please let me help you.

573
00:46:19.830 --> 00:46:22.200
那个系统  罗波安
The system... Rehoboam...

574
00:46:23.920 --> 00:46:27.180
有时我希望能关闭这些东西
Sometimes, I wish I could just turn the whole fucking thing off.

575
00:46:27.320 --> 00:46:28.250
彻底终止
Kill it.

576
00:46:28.320 --> 00:46:31.030
为什么不行呢  是你在控制
Why can't you? You control it.

577
00:46:32.360 --> 00:46:33.350
不  不是我
No, I don't.

578
00:46:34.720 --> 00:46:35.990
我从来都没有控制权
I never have.

579
00:46:39.130 --> 00:46:40.350
在我父亲死后
After my father died,

580
00:46:40.350 --> 00:46:43.150
他的合作伙伴限制我进入系统
his partner locked me out of the system.

581
00:46:44.360 --> 00:46:46.360
我有读取外层的权限
I have read access to the outer layers,

582
00:46:46.360 --> 00:46:47.670
但也仅此而已
but nothing deeper.

583
00:46:47.990 --> 00:46:50.000
你完全不知道系统在做什么
You have no idea what the system is doing.

584
00:46:50.730 --> 00:46:53.390
我去办公室上班  我挥霍钱财
I go to the office. I spend the money.

585
00:46:53.960 --> 00:46:55.580
但我只是个傀儡
I'm a fucking figurehead.

586
00:46:57.430 --> 00:47:00.190
没人知道系统在做什么
No one knows what the system is doing.

587
00:47:03.760 --> 00:47:05.750
除了最初的缔造者
Other than its original architect.

588
00:47:06.620 --> 00:47:07.370
是谁
Who?

589
00:47:08.780 --> 00:47:11.310
请让我帮忙吧  告诉我那个人是谁
Please let me help. Tell me who it is.

590
00:47:11.310 --> 00:47:14.700
如果我真打算告诉你  那他已经知道了
If I was going to tell you, he'd know already.

591
00:47:15.400 --> 00:47:16.740
罗波安会告诉他
Rehoboam would tell him.

592
00:47:17.240 --> 00:47:20.150
那我已经死了  和我爸一样
And I'd already be dead. Just like my dad.

593
00:47:20.410 --> 00:47:23.930
但你没死  你活得好好的  和我安全的在一起
But you're not dead. You're here, safe with me.

594
00:47:24.190 --> 00:47:26.870
你信任我  利亚姆  我知道的

告诉我和你父亲合作的那个人的名字
Tell me the name of the person your father was working with.

596
00:47:40.560 --> 00:47:42.280
你他妈在干什么
What the fuck are you doing?

597
00:47:42.530 --> 00:47:44.360
你他妈又是在干什么
The fuck are you doing?

598
00:47:47.080 --> 00:47:49.870
你知不知道你在和谁说话
You have any real idea who you were talking to?

599
00:47:52.770 --> 00:47:54.570
你不是做了背景调查吗
I thought you did a background check.

600
00:47:56.470 --> 00:47:59.980
她做得周密  第一实验室没查出来
She was thorough. First lab missed it.

601
00:48:01.720 --> 00:48:05.460
劳拉·埃斯彭是一名12岁的乌克兰小女孩
Lara Espen was a 12-year-old girl from Ukraine

602
00:48:05.460 --> 00:48:08.060
十年前死于车祸

603
00:48:09.010 --> 00:48:11.990
她父母把她的遗体捐献给了医学研究机构

604
00:48:11.990 --> 00:48:16.070
她的血液和组织大约三个月前不见了
Her blood and tissue disappeared about three months ago.

605
00:48:16.250 --> 00:48:18.740
我不知道她是什么人
I don't know who the fuck this is,

606
00:48:18.900 --> 00:48:23.080
但我非常确定她不是一个死去的基辅女孩
but I'm pretty confident she's not a dead teenager from Kiev.

607
00:48:23.700 --> 00:48:25.510
不  我了解她
No. I know her.

608
00:48:33.210 --> 00:48:34.400
再瞧瞧这个
There's that.

609
00:48:35.340 --> 00:48:37.780
我们窃听了她的电话
We tapped into the traffic in her phone.

610
00:48:38.580 --> 00:48:40.590
昨晚她发了一条短信
She sent one text last night.

611
00:48:40.810 --> 00:48:43.680
是加密的  花了四分钟才破解
Encrypted. Took four minutes to crack.

612
00:48:45.710 --> 00:48:49.490
{\an8}{\pos(301.395,10.71)}是时候了  今晚我会引他出来

613
00:48:46.170 --> 00:48:49.920
地点是在东区的一个地下通道
The location is an underpass on the east side.

614
00:48:50.590 --> 00:48:53.640
她总不可能是要办惊喜派对吧
And I can't imagine she's throwing a surprise party.

615
00:48:56.060 --> 00:48:58.660
有可能是商业间谍活动
Could be industrial espionage.

616
00:48:59.020 --> 00:49:01.510
或者她只是想要你的钱
Or she just wanted your money.

617
00:49:01.510 --> 00:49:02.870
那我们该怎么做
Okay, so what do we do?

618
00:49:03.230 --> 00:49:04.790
打电话报警吧
Call the police, yeah?

619
00:49:08.030 --> 00:49:09.480
打给联邦警察吗
Call the feds?

620
00:49:10.530 --> 00:49:13.920
我为你父亲守护这家公司
I've safeguarded the fortunes of this company for your father

621
00:49:13.920 --> 00:49:16.460
已经20年了
for 20 fucking years.

622
00:49:19.850 --> 00:49:23.210
所以我会负责收拾残局
So, I'll be the one to clean up this fucking mess.

623
00:49:30.130 --> 00:49:32.440
只要保证事情不会牵连到我就行
Just be sure it doesn't blow back on me.

624
00:49:37.020 --> 00:49:38.140
好了  亲爱的
All right, darling.

625
00:49:39.170 --> 00:49:40.740
我们带你去赴约吧
Let's get you to your date.

626
00:49:42.510 --> 00:49:44.500
别让你的朋友们久等
Let's not keep your friends waiting.

627
00:49:55.590 --> 00:49:58.480
告诉你的六名手下去着陆区跟我们汇合
Tell six of the guys to meet us at the LZ.

628
00:49:58.860 --> 00:50:00.870
雇一些本地的英才
Hire some local talent.

629
00:50:02.700 --> 00:50:04.540
把她除掉
Let's dose and dump this one.

630
00:50:25.530 --> 00:50:26.470
这是什么
What's this?

631
00:50:26.470 --> 00:50:28.450
不知道  也不想知道
Don't know, man. Don't wanna know.

632
00:50:29.260 --> 00:50:30.920
他们要这个和车子
They want this and the car.

633
00:50:35.500 --> 00:50:37.030
你知道怎么开这车吗
You know how to drive one of those things?

634
00:51:27.440 --> 00:51:28.570
来得正是时候
Right on time.

635
00:51:35.810 --> 00:51:36.780
包
Bag.

636
00:51:48.670 --> 00:51:49.800
这是什么
What is this?

637
00:51:51.110 --> 00:51:52.600
我不接私人活儿
I don't do personals.

638
00:51:52.600 --> 00:51:54.890
你误会了  走吧
You've got the wrong idea. Beat it.

639
00:51:59.160 --> 00:52:00.320
我叫你快走
I said beat it.

640
00:52:05.480 --> 00:52:08.640
我不是第一次被人拿枪指着
It's not the first time I've had a gun pointed at me.

641
00:52:08.820 --> 00:52:11.250
你想第一次被人爆头吗
You wanna make it the first time you've been shot in the head?

642
00:52:11.250 --> 00:52:13.160
已经有人先你一步了
Someone else beat you to that, too.

643
00:52:36.650 --> 00:52:37.630
长官
Sir.

644
00:52:45.990 --> 00:52:47.010
把她带过来
Bring her.

645
00:53:25.170 --> 00:53:27.470
卡莱布  你怎么样
Caleb, how you doing, my man?

646
00:53:27.630 --> 00:53:28.780
有时间聊两句吗
You got time to talk?

647
00:53:28.780 --> 00:53:30.040
好啊
Yeah, why not?

648
00:53:46.850 --> 00:53:47.990
够了
That's enough.

649
00:53:49.450 --> 00:53:52.410
接头人可能突然反应过来  提前溜了
Handlers probably got wise and scarpered.

650
00:53:53.120 --> 00:53:54.200
给我
Give me that.

651
00:54:13.230 --> 00:54:14.370
小妞
Girly.

652
00:54:15.700 --> 00:54:18.190
我不知道你这小骗子是从哪来的
I don't know where your grifting little arse came from,

653
00:54:18.210 --> 00:54:21.780
但你闯荡富人阶层的旅程到此为止
but this ends your tour of the rich and feckless.

654
00:54:22.050 --> 00:54:26.050
别担心  恐怕也不会有人会想你的
Don't worry. I can't imagine anyone's gonna miss you.

655
00:54:27.360 --> 00:54:29.060
一两针应该就可以了
One or two of them should do it.

656
00:54:54.160 --> 00:54:55.130
你在干什么
What are you doing?

657
00:54:55.610 --> 00:54:57.360
我给她打了两针  她还有呼吸
I gave her two and she's still breathin'.

658
00:54:58.150 --> 00:54:59.640
这是绝对不可能的
It's not fucking possible.

659
00:55:00.160 --> 00:55:01.180
给我
Give me that.

660
00:55:02.010 --> 00:55:04.610
想把事情做好  就得自己动手
You want something done right, you do it yourself.

661
00:55:10.900 --> 00:55:12.070
这是怎么回事
The fuck is this?

662
00:55:17.030 --> 00:55:19.810
解决她  我来搞定这个混蛋
Finish her off. I'll take care of this fucker.

663
00:55:35.410 --> 00:55:36.400
听我指令
On me.

664
00:55:47.490 --> 00:55:48.660
搞什么
The fuck?

665
00:55:50.780 --> 00:55:52.240
让他们都过来
Get the boys over here.

666
00:55:53.900 --> 00:55:55.430
全都过来
Get over here!

667
00:55:55.480 --> 00:55:56.580
他说什么
What is he saying?

668
00:57:13.870 --> 00:57:16.070
我一直在想你说我对你说过的那句话
I've been thinking about what you said I told you.

669
00:57:16.420 --> 00:57:17.380
你说过的
You have.

670
00:57:17.380 --> 00:57:18.730
说这游戏被人暗箱操纵了
That the game is rigged.

671
00:57:19.350 --> 00:57:20.450
那句怎么了
What about it?

672
00:57:20.500 --> 00:57:21.710
就算这是真的
That even if it is,

673
00:57:22.040 --> 00:57:25.560
如果你想要赢  还是得玩下去  不是吗
you still have to play if you want a chance to win, right?

674
00:57:29.440 --> 00:57:30.430
不
No.

675
00:57:31.200 --> 00:57:33.560
你以前的想法可不是这样的
That's not what you thought at all.

676
00:57:35.150 --> 00:57:37.680
我是说真正的你
The real you, I mean.

677
00:57:38.730 --> 00:57:42.120
你说系统根本就不在乎我们
You said that the system didn't care about us at all.

678
00:57:42.590 --> 00:57:45.720
他们根本不在乎我们的死活
They didn't give a shit if we lived or died.

679
00:57:46.350 --> 00:57:48.700
我们必须要有自己的计划
That we had to have our own plan.

680
00:57:49.330 --> 00:57:50.630
团结一致
Stick together.

681
00:57:51.720 --> 00:57:52.930
你说得没错
And you were right.

682
00:57:54.740 --> 00:57:58.770
但你根本不必去想  要如何在这个世界生存
But you never had to figure out how to live in this world.

683
00:57:59.670 --> 00:58:03.270
因为你...没能活着回来
Because you... never made it back.

684
00:58:05.200 --> 00:58:08.550
我也希望你还活着  但你没有
And I wish you were here, but you are not.

685
00:58:24.050 --> 00:58:26.720
好吧  那我们来好好聊聊这事  卡尔
All right, let's talk about that, Cal.

686
00:58:27.200 --> 00:58:28.210
不
No.

687
00:58:29.400 --> 00:58:30.590
我们不聊了
Let's not.

688
00:58:34.530 --> 00:58:38.080
听着  我很感激你努力帮我
Listen, I appreciate what you're trying to do here,

689
00:58:39.230 --> 00:58:41.220
但恐怕这对我来说没用
but I don't think it's working for me.

690
00:58:41.570 --> 00:58:42.850
那你打算怎么做
So, what do you wanna do?

691
00:58:47.150 --> 00:58:49.810
我想如果我要继续我的人生
I think if I'm gonna get on with my life,

692
00:58:50.370 --> 00:58:52.420
我就要找到一些...
I'm gonna have to find something...

693
00:58:53.670 --> 00:58:56.440
一些...真实的东西
someone... real.

你不需要去找
You won't need to.

708
01:00:47.060 --> 01:00:48.630
他有一个系统

709

他可能现在就在找你
He's probably looking for you right now.

710
01:00:56.150 --> 01:00:58.140
你永远无法接近利亚姆
You'll never get close to Liam.

711

你没有崇拜的神  但你却想造一个神

715
01:01:19.270 --> 01:01:21.520
但是你所创造出来的不是神

716
01:01:23.740 --> 01:01:25.300
真正的神要降临了

恐怕没人会想你的

我来告诉你
Let me show you

738

01:10:14.060 --> 01:10:15.670
我要去哪里

我们都有各自需要扮演的角色

我不知道她在谋划什么

梅芙  你是为了梅芙回来的
